\section modes Ways to Use Xlw

There are 4 main ways to use Xlw

- \subpage a01_cppwrappedxll "C++ Wrapped Xlls"
- \subpage a02_cppxll "C++ Native Xlls"
- \subpage a03_clixll "C++/CLI Hybrid Xlls"

For first time users of Xlw we suggest using \ref a01_cppwrappedxll "C++ Wrapped Xlls" as this removes the need to use 
Excel types and maintain the registrations manually.
